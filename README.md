# WSL-Linux-Fast-Shell
With this scripts, you will open your WSL shell faster

# terminal.py
Copy to somewhere easy to execute. This will start WSL

# start.sh
At first you have to move start.sh to /usr/bin/start 
`mv start.sh /usr/bin/start`

# wsl-start.py
When you `start` this file will be executed and will clear the terminal,change the /etc/resolv.conf file to "nameserver 8.8.8.8",clear the terminal again,say who you are and will switch to root terminal.

I hope this will help you and make your life easier :D!

Happy Hacking!
